# Best Practices & Final Project

## Goal

Master professional Python development practices and complete a final project that demonstrates all your skills.

## Explanation

You have learned Python from basics to advanced concepts. Now learn **best practices** - how professional developers write high-quality, maintainable code.

**Code organization:**
```
my_project/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── views.py
│   └── utils.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_models.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── main.py
```

**Documentation:**

```python
def calculate_total(items, tax_rate=0.08):
    """
    Calculate total price including tax.
    
    Args:
        items (list): List of item prices
        tax_rate (float): Tax rate (default 0.08 for 8%)
    
    Returns:
        float: Total price with tax
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_total([10, 20, 30])
        64.8
    """
    subtotal = sum(items)
    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
```

**Error handling:**
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    raise
finally:
    cleanup_resources()
```

This reference project includes:
- A complete, production-ready "Task Manager" application
- Professional folder structure
- Unit tests
- Database integration
- Documentation and README

**Note:** This project requires real Python installed on your computer.

---

**Code style:**
```python
# Good - clear, descriptive
def calculate_user_age_in_years(birth_date):
    """Calculate age from birth date."""
    pass

# Bad - unclear
def calc(d):
    pass
```

## Final Project Assignment

**Build a complete application using everything you learned:**

**Project Options:**
1. **Personal Finance Tracker**
   - Track income/expenses
   - Categorize transactions
   - Generate reports
   - Visualize spending

2. **Task Management System**
   - Create/edit/delete tasks
   - Set priorities and deadlines
   - Mark complete
   - Filter and search

3. **Contact Management App**
   - Store contacts (name, phone, email)
   - Search and filter
   - Import/export CSV
   - Web interface (Flask)

**Requirements:**
- Use functions and classes (OOP)
- Store data in database (SQLite)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write at least 3 tests
- Create README with setup instructions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Add comments and docstrings

**Deliverables:**
1. Source code (organized in folders)
2. requirements.txt
3. README.md (how to run)
4. Test file
5. Sample data

## Guided Practice

Project structure template:

```python
# models.py
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title, description):
        self.title = title
        self.description = description
        self.completed = False

# database.py
import sqlite3

class Database:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
        self.create_tables()
    
    def create_tables(self):
        # Create table SQL
        pass

# main.py
from models import Task
from database import Database

def main():
    db = Database('tasks.db')
    # Application logic
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Reflection

**Final Assessment - Can you:**
1. ✅ Understand and write Python code
2. ✅ Debug errors using error messages
3. ✅ Build programs from scratch
4. ✅ Use libraries and frameworks
5. ✅ Work with data and databases
6. ✅ Create web applications
7. ✅ Write tests and documentation
8. ✅ Deploy applications
9. ✅ Follow best practices
10. ✅ **Build real products independently**

**If you answered YES to all:** 🎉 **You are a Python developer!**
